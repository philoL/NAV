# NAV: An Interactive Visualization Tool to Analyze Various Name Relationships among NDN packets

NAV is an interactive visualization tool, designed for NDN applications to show various name relationships among NDN Data packets, in order to understand, analyze and demonstrate the design philosophies or policies. It can also help to debug an NDN application to some extend. Currently, it has namespace view, trust schema view and name-based access control view. We used the tool for the demonstration of the open mHealth project at SIGCOMM 2017.
